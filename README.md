Our idea for a project is a 3D modeling software. The business model for this software would be in the form of consultation. A company or developer who would want to use the project would have the option to either dive in themselves and try to figure things out or pay for either a one time consultation or a reccuring consultation on a subscribtion basis. The MIT license is perfect for this project as we want everyone to be able to use our software however they like. If a user desires use our software to model something they do not want out in the public yet we are not going to force them to share, which is why we steered away from any copyleft licenses.
